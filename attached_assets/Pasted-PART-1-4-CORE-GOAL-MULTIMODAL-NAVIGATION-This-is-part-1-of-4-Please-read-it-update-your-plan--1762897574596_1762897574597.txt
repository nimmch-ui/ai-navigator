PART 1/4 – CORE GOAL & MULTIMODAL NAVIGATION

This is part 1 of 4. Please read it, update your plan, but don’t start any heavy refactors until you receive all 4 parts.

App context:
- This project is "AI Navigator" – a web navigation app built with React + Vite + TypeScript.
- Mapping must be powered by Mapbox (using the token in VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN).
- AI chat uses OpenAI via Replit’s integration (no direct OpenAI key needed).

Core goal:
Turn this app into a world-class, AI-powered navigation system that feels better than current top apps (Google Maps, Waze, Radarbot, MapXplorer, etc.), with:
- multimodal routing (car, bike, walk, transit),
- smart AI guidance,
- speed-camera awareness and speed limit warnings,
- eco driving mode,
- weather and hazard awareness,
- voice guidance,
- beautiful & smooth UI, close to a “live 3D” feel.

Architecture:
- Use Mapbox GL JS (or the Mapbox map wrapper already in the project) instead of Leaflet long-term.
- Keep API keys only in env variables (VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN etc.).
- Organize code into clear modules:
  - services/mapbox/*
  - services/routing/*
  - services/radar/*
  - services/weather/*
  - components/navigation/*
  - components/ui/*

Multimodal routing – initial implementation:
1. Add a mode selector UI on top of the map:
   - Car 🚗, Bike 🚲, Walk 🚶, Transit 🚆.
   - For now, Transit can reuse driving-traffic as a placeholder but keep the code ready for a real transit API later.

2. Use Mapbox Directions API profiles:
   - driving-traffic for car / transit,
   - cycling for bike,
   - walking for walk.

3. Add a simple “Start navigation” flow:
   - User enters a destination (we’ll refine search in part 2),
   - Selects mode (Car/Bike/Walk/Transit),
   - Clicks “Start navigation” → draw route on the map,
   - Show basic turn-by-turn steps in a side panel.

4. Make sure routing code is written so it can later support:
   - route preferences (Fastest/Shortest/Eco),
   - additional metadata like current speed limit, traffic level, etc.

Please acknowledge PART 1/4, update your internal plan, and wait for PART 2/4 before refactoring everything.
