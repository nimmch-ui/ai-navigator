PART 1/2 – MASTER PROMPT FOR AI NAVIGATOR UPGRADE

Goal:
Upgrade my existing “AI Navigator” app into a very advanced, multimodal AI navigation system with radar awareness and smart guidance.

Tech stack:
- React + Vite + TypeScript
- Mapbox (map + geocoding + routing)
- OpenAI API for the AI assistant
- Mapbox token is in VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN
- OpenAI key is in OPENAI_API_KEY
Please keep using env variables (import.meta.env.VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN, etc.), do NOT hard-code keys.

High-level vision:
I want an AI-powered navigation app that combines features similar to Google Maps + Waze + a smart driving assistant:
- multiple transport modes (car, bike, walking, transit),
- smart route planning (fastest / shortest / eco),
- speed limit + radar awareness and warnings,
- weather and traffic-aware routing,
- voice guidance,
- AI chat assistant in the sidebar,
- favourites and route history.

1. MULTI-MODAL NAVIGATION

Add a clear UI control at the top of the map to choose the transport mode:
- Car 🚗
- Bike 🚲
- Walk 🚶
- Transit 🚆 (for now you can reuse driving-traffic as a placeholder, but structure the code so we can later plug in real transit APIs).

Use Mapbox Directions API with profiles:
- driving-traffic for car,
- walking for walk,
- cycling for bike.

Behaviour:
- The user types a destination in the search bar.
- Selects a mode (car / bike / walk / transit).
- Clicks “Start navigation”.
- The app draws the route on the map and shows turn-by-turn instructions in a panel (for example on the left or right of the map).
- If the user changes the mode, start or destination, recompute the route.

2. SMART SEARCH (GEOCODING + AUTOCOMPLETE)

Use Mapbox Geocoding API for the search bar:
- while typing, show autocomplete suggestions.
- when the user selects a suggestion, move the map camera to that location and treat it as the destination.
- when the user presses Enter, if there is at least one suggestion, use the first suggestion by default.

Error handling:
- if geocoding fails or no results are found, show a visible red banner or toast:
  “Search error – location not found or geocoding failed.”

3. RADARS AND SPEED CAMERAS – DATA MODEL

Create a separate TypeScript module for speed cameras / radars, for example:
- src/data/speedCameras.ts

Define a type like:
- id
- position (lat, lng)
- speedLimitKmh
- direction (optional)
- source

For now, use mock/demo data:
- put a handful of cameras around San Francisco (or Zurich) so I can see them on the map.

On the map:
- show each radar as a special marker or symbol (e.g. 🚨 icon).
- when hovering or tapping, show a tooltip like: “Speed camera – limit 80 km/h”.

In the architecture, design this so that later we can easily replace the mock data with a real API (OpenStreetMap or public radar APIs).
